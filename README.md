# CardGameDemo

This is a simple card game demo written in Java that I use for demo of Distributed Tracing.
It uses 2 external services 
1. lookupService to lookup the commission calculator service
2. gameCommCalc to get a commission for the play.

The 2 other services are written in Go and I have included them under the "external-services" folder.
